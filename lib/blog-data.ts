    description:
      "Understanding the power of React Server Components and how they're changing the way we build React applications.",
    content: `# React Server Components Explained

React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we think about React applications.

## What are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that render on the server, allowing you to:

- **Reduce bundle size**: Server Components don't ship JavaScript to the client
- **Access server resources**: Directly access databases, file systems, etc.
- **Improve performance**: Faster initial page loads and better SEO

## Server vs Client Components

### Server Components
- Render on the server
- Can access server-side resources
- Cannot use hooks or browser APIs
- Don't add to the JavaScript bundle

### Client Components
- Render on the client
- Can use hooks and browser APIs
- Interactive and stateful
- Add to the JavaScript bundle

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default**
2. **Mark Client Components with 'use client'**
3. **Pass data down from Server to Client Components**
4. **Avoid mixing server and client logic**

## Example Implementation

\`\`\`tsx
// Server Component (default)
async function BlogPost({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(id) // Server-side data fetching
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <ClientInteractiveComponent data={post} />
    </article>
  )
}

// Client Component
'use client'
function ClientInteractiveComponent({ data }: { data: Post }) {
  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>
      {liked ? '‚ù§Ô∏è' : 'ü§ç'} Like
    </button>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Server Components are a powerful addition to React that enables better performance and developer experience when used correctly.`,

    description:
      "Learn how to create inclusive web experiences that work for everyone, including users with disabilities.",
    content: `# Building Accessible Web Applications

Web accessibility ensures that your applications can be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusive design**: Reach a broader audience
- **Legal compliance**: Meet accessibility standards
- **Better UX**: Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **SEO benefits**: Screen readers and search engines have similar needs

## Key Principles (WCAG)

### 1. Perceivable
Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive:

- Provide text alternatives for images
- Offer captions for videos
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable to different presentations

### 2. Operable
Interface components must be operable:

- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Don't use content that causes seizures
- Help users navigate and find content

### 3. Understandable
Information and UI operation must be understandable:

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies:

- Maximize compatibility with assistive technologies
- Use valid, semantic HTML
- Ensure content works across different browsers and devices

## Practical Implementation

### Semantic HTML

\`\`\`html
<main>
  <article>
    <header>
      <h1>Article Title</h1>
      <time datetime="2024-01-15">January 15, 2024</time>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h2>Section Heading</h2>
      <p>Content...</p>
    </section>
  </article>
</main>
\`\`\`

### ARIA Labels

\`\`\`html
<button aria-label="Close dialog" aria-expanded="false">
  <span aria-hidden="true">√ó</span>
</button>
\`\`\`

### Focus Management

\`\`\`css
.focus-visible:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #4f46e5;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
\`\`\`

## Testing Tools

1. **Screen readers**: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
2. **Browser extensions**: axe DevTools, WAVE
3. **Automated testing**: jest-axe, cypress-axe
4. **Manual testing**: Keyboard navigation, color contrast

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Missing alt text for images
- Poor color contrast
- Inaccessible forms
- Missing focus indicators
- Non-semantic HTML

## Conclusion

Building accessible web applications is not just about compliance‚Äîit's about creating inclusive experiences that benefit all users.`,

    title: "TypeScript Best Practices for 2024",
    description: "Essential TypeScript patterns and practices to write more maintainable and type-safe code.",
    content: `# TypeScript Best Practices for 2024

TypeScript continues to evolve, and staying up-to-date with best practices is crucial for writing maintainable code.

## Essential TypeScript Features

### 1. Strict Mode Configuration

Always enable strict mode in your \`tsconfig.json\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Utility Types

Leverage built-in utility types:

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  age?: number
}

// Pick specific properties
type UserSummary = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>

// Make all properties optional
type PartialUser = Partial<User>

// Make all properties required
type RequiredUser = Required<User>

// Exclude properties
type UserWithoutAge = Omit<User, 'age'>
\`\`\`

### 3. Generic Constraints

Use generic constraints for more precise types:

\`\`\`typescript
interface Identifiable {
  id: string
}

function updateEntity<T extends Identifiable>(
  entity: T,
  updates: Partial<T>
): T {
  return { ...entity, ...updates }
}
\`\`\`

### 4. Discriminated Unions

Create type-safe state management:

\`\`\`typescript
type LoadingState = 
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: any }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string }

function handleState(state: LoadingState) {
  switch (state.status) {
    case 'idle':
      return 'Not started'
    case 'loading':
      return 'Loading...'
    case 'success':
      return state.data // TypeScript knows data exists
    case 'error':
      return state.error // TypeScript knows error exists
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Patterns

### 1. Branded Types

Create distinct types for similar values:

\`\`\`typescript
type UserId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol }
type ProductId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol }

function createUserId(id: string): UserId {
  return id as UserId
}

function getUser(id: UserId) {
  // Implementation
}

// This prevents mixing up IDs
const userId = createUserId('user-123')
const productId = 'product-456' as ProductId

getUser(userId) // ‚úÖ Correct
getUser(productId) // ‚ùå Type error
\`\`\`

### 2. Template Literal Types

Create dynamic string types:

\`\`\`typescript
type EventName = \`on\${Capitalize<string>}\`
type Color = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue'
type ColorVariant = \`\${Color}-\${100 | 200 | 300}\`

// Results in: 'red-100' | 'red-200' | 'red-300' | 'green-100' | etc.
\`\`\`

### 3. Conditional Types

Create types that depend on other types:

\`\`\`typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = T extends string
  ? { message: T }
  : T extends number
  ? { count: T }
  : { data: T }

type StringResponse = ApiResponse<string> // { message: string }
type NumberResponse = ApiResponse<number> // { count: number }
type ObjectResponse = ApiResponse<User> // { data: User }
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Use \`unknown\` instead of \`any\`** when you don't know the type
2. **Prefer type assertions over type casting** when necessary
3. **Use const assertions** for immutable data
4. **Leverage mapped types** for transforming existing types
5. **Use namespace imports** for better organization

## Common Pitfalls

- Overusing \`any\` type
- Not enabling strict mode
- Ignoring TypeScript errors
- Not using utility types
- Poor generic constraints

## Conclusion

TypeScript's type system is powerful and continues to improve. Following these best practices will help you write more maintainable and type-safe code.`,
